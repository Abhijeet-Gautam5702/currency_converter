# Currency Converter

This is a very simple and basic currency converter mobile app built using Flutter and Dart. It converts currencies from USD, Pounds and Euros to Indian Rupees.   
This project does not leverage any APIs for its working and all the values (conversion factors) are harcoded.   
This project marks the starting of my Flutter App Development learning journey.
